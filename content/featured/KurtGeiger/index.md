My most challenging time as a web developper and the biggest website I have worked on.
During my time there I have been involved in practically all the parts of the website.
Developed Unit and End to End Automation testing, extracted Magento component to create independent APIs, Migration to Magento 2 and the replacement of the payment module were all part of my daily routine there.
