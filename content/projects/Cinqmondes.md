My first project on Magento. My goal was to create the connection between the Cinq Mondes marketing team and the Magento agency that who built and maintained the website. I managed all the work that was submited to the Agency and was making sure everything was in aligment with the company's vision.
I also built a B2B space where the partners could access some private downloadables.
