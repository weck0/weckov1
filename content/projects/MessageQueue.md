Building a new system that would generate a new message for each new order effectued on the Magento 2 website. Basically publishing a new Message Queue linked on a Magento observer in a json format.
Was really glad to learn about the Message queue and RabbitMQ's solution turned out to be a perfect fit to our problem.
